        SafeCare is a home-visiting program for families with children ages 0-5.
        It focuses on creating positive relationships between caregivers and
        their children, ensuring homes are safe to reduce the risk of child
        unintentional injury and keeping children as healthy as possible.
        SafeCare is typically completed over the course of 18 weekly sessions.
        Each session lasts approximately one hour.
