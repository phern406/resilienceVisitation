I’m opening Resilience up to providing visits for families that aren’t involved with CFS.  Any chance you can make a couple changes to the website?

 

<!-- 1. On the home page, can you please take out “to families involved with CFS” in the first sentence.  So it should read “Resilience Visitation was founded in 2019 to transform the ways supervised visitation and parenting supports are offered in the Bozeman area.” -->

<!-- 2. On the About page can you please replace the second paragraph that starts with “At this time…” with “If you would like more to inquire about any of our services, please contact us HERE.” -->

3. On the Models page can you please add “We use Visit Coaching with all our private pay clients.  You can learn more about private pay services HERE.”  (link to the new “New Clients” page).

4. Can you please create a new page labeled “New Clients.” 
(A) The text will be “We are accepting new clients for supervised visitation.  All private pay visits are facilitated using the Visit Coaching model. (link to the same Visit Coaching website we’re linked to on the models page)  Our ability to accept new clients may be limited by staff and facility availability.   Private pay visitation is available in Bozeman/Belgrade and Livingston.  Please contact us HERE (link my email) to inquire about availability.”

(B)Then add a couple links to Word docs I’ve attached (changing them to PDFS or something else is totally fine!):
