We don’t take shortcuts and we routinely find ourselves\n      involved in journeys of addiction, mental health challenges, and cycles of\n      abuse. We work in a system that sometimes brings more challenges than\n      support. Occasionally we get blamed for things we cannot control. If\n      you’re looking for a job where you can just skate along, we’re not for\n      you!\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ marginRight: \"15px\", marginLeft: \"20px\" }}>\n      Of course, we also have the profound privilege of journeying with families\n      through extraordinarily difficult circumstances. We support one another.\n      We bear witness and offer support as people break the cycle of abuse and\n      neglect. Equally, we bear witness as parents fail and as children face the\n      consequences of their parents’ inability to break those cycles. Through\n      professional training and our patient presence, we make a significant\n      difference in many of these journeys. The challenges are daunting, but for\n      us the rewards are greater. If that sounds like something you’d like to be\n      a part of, take a look at our job descriptions below.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      {/* <h4>Resilience Visitation Bozeman, MT</h4> */}\n      <br />\n      <Accordion>\n        <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"0\">\n          <Accordion.Header>Family Connection Specialist</Accordion.Header>\n          <Accordion.Body>\n            Our Family Connection Specialists are established social services\n            professionals who extend our mission of supporting families through\n            their journeys of transformation that break cycles of abuse and\n            neglect.

Parenting can be hard. There’s a reason people say “it takes a village.”\n\nResilience Visitation is seeking a professional in social services ready to come alongside parents navigating the child welfare system. We support parents in 1.) recognizing and meeting their children’s needs, 2.) having regular opportunities to connect with their children in foster care and 3.) developing the discipline and skill they need to address the concern(s) that led to their children’s removal. This will be a FT position.\n\nResilience Visitation is an innovative new provider of family visitation in Bozeman, Livingston, and the surrounding area. We are led by our shared commitment to fostering resilience, offering dignity, and practicing transparency. We work closely with Child and Family Services, foster parents, and other service providers to bring separated families opportunities to nurture relationships in the most natural setting possible and to support parents as they work toward their treatment plan goals.\n\nWe are seeking the right individual ready to enhance our ability to impact our community. This candidate is eager to help us serve and enrich families who lose custody of their children. They understand that everyone has a story and they know that change is a slow process. They will strive to bring empathy to every situation, learn to see dignity in every individual, and consistently offer our families accountability and opportunities for growth.\n\nSuccessful applicants will have a good driving record and access to their own vehicle suitable for transporting children. Mileage on personal vehicles will be reimbursed.
