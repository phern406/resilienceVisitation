     always easy. We don’t take shortcuts and we routinely find ourselves\n      involved in journeys of addiction, mental health challenges, and cycles of\n      abuse. We work in a system that sometimes brings more challenges than\n      support. Occasionally we get blamed for things we cannot control. If\n      you’re looking for a job where you can just skate along, we’re not for\n      you!\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ marginRight: \"15px\", marginLeft: \"20px\" }}>\n      Of course, we also have the profound privilege of journeying with families\n      through extraordinarily difficult circumstances. We support one another.\n      We bear witness and offer support as people break the cycle of abuse and\n      neglect. Equally, we bear witness as parents fail and as children face the\n      consequences of their parents’ inability to break those cycles. Through\n      professional training and our patient presence, we make a significant difference as families work to break cycles of abuse and neglect. \n      The challenges are daunting, but for\n      us the rewards are greater. If that sounds like something you’d like to be\n      a part of, take a look at our job descriptions below.{\" \"}\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <br />\n      <Accordion>\n        <Accordion.Item eventKey=\"0\">\n          <Accordion.Header>Family Connection Specialist</Accordion.Header>\n          <Accordion.Body>\n            Our Family Connection Specialists are established social services\n            professionals who extend our mission of supporting families through\n            their journeys of transformation that break cycles of abuse and\n            neglect.
